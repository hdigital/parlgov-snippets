#### Description

The script analyses the structure of *cabinet support parties* in Israel. Cabinet support parties are not formal members of the cabinet, but are aligned with the cabinet parties. Often, cabinet support parties provide a parliamentary majority for a cabinet.

With the support of Or Tuttnauer and Ofer Kenig, the *ParlGov* team updated Israeli cabinets and cabinet support parties in 2020. ParlGov now includes all support parties with a deputy minister and Arab satellite lists.

The ParlGov experimental version provides the data in a [_cabinet_support_](http://www.parlgov.org/data/table/cabinet_support/) table. The data is incomplete for other countries.
