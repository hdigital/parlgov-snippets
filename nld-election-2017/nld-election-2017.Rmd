__Election Netherlands 15 March 2017__

This morning, two facts from yesterdays Dutch election were particularly striking to me.

 * The __Social Democracts__ (PVdA) fell from __24.8% in 2012__ to __5.7%__ vote share.
 * The __largest party__ (Liberals, VVD) won only __21.3%__ vote share.

The Economist has a [nice chart](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/03/daily-chart-10) visualizing the results.

I wondered what these effects are in a comparative perspective and conducted an analysis with data from
[ParlGov](http://www.parlgov.org/).

Here are the main facts.

 1. The electoral loss of the Social Democrats (PVdA) was particularly bad.
 2. A largest party with little more than 20% vote share is less exceptional nowadays.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

library(knitr)
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
```

I use the data from [ParlGov](http://www.parlgov.org/) and limit my analysis to older democracies,
excluding countries from Central/Eastern Europe.

```{r get_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
db_file <- 'parlgov.db'
url <- 'http://www.parlgov.org/static/data/parlgov-experimental.db'
if( ! db_file %in% list.files()) download.file(url, db_file, mode='wb')
parlgov_db <- src_sqlite(db_file)

get_decade <- function(election_date) year(election_date) %/% 10 * 10

get_parlgov_table <- function(table_name) tbl(parlgov_db, table_name) %>% as_tibble
party_raw <- get_parlgov_table('view_party')
elec_raw <- get_parlgov_table('view_election')

elec <- elec_raw %>%
  filter(election_type == 'parliament',
         election_date >= '1945-01-01') %>%
  mutate(country = country_name,
         decade = get_decade(election_date)) %>%
  left_join(party_raw %>% select(party_id, family=family_name_short)) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(min(election_date) <= '1980-01-01') %>%
  ungroup

elec_info <- get_parlgov_table('election')
turnout <- elec_info %>% 
  filter(id %in% elec$election_id) %>% 
  mutate(decade = get_decade(date)) %>% 
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  summarize(turnout = mean(votes_valid / electorate, na.rm=T))

results <- get_parlgov_table('election_result')
alliance <- results %>%
  filter(id %in% alliance_id) %>%
  mutate(tmp = paste(election_id, party_id)) %>%
  .[['tmp']]

cabinet <- get_parlgov_table('view_cabinet')
cab_party <- cabinet %>%
  filter(cabinet_party == 1) %>%
  distinct(election_id, party_id) %>%
  mutate(cabinet = 1)
```

First, I look at the electoral performance of the Dutch Social Democrats (PVdA) with the following information.

 * mean vote share PVdA by decade
 * PVdA election results compared to Social Democrats in Germany and Sweden
 * party family vote share by decade
 * large electoral losses in old democracies

# PvdA vote share

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Logo_PvdA.svg/320px-Logo_PvdA.svg.png)

The [PVd](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/NLD/party/742/)
has always been less successful than the German and Swedish Social Democrats. Nevertheless, the 2017 result is particularly bad (see also vote loss comparison below).

```{r pvda, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
socdem <- elec %>%
  filter(party_id %in% c(558, 742, 904)) %>%  # NOR-104 SWE-904
  mutate(year = year(election_date),
         party = paste(stringi::stri_trans_totitle(country_name_short), party_name_short, sep=' - ')) %>%
  bind_rows(tibble(party='Nld - PvdA', party_name_short='PvdA',
                   decade=2010, year=2017, vote_share=5.7))

pvda <- socdem %>%
  filter(party_name_short == 'PvdA') %>%
  group_by(decade) %>%
  summarise(vote_share = round(mean(vote_share, na.rm=T), 0)) %>%
  spread(decade, vote_share)
pvda %>% kable

ggplot(socdem, aes(year, vote_share, color=party)) + geom_line() + ylim(0, 60)
```

# Party family share

Here, I present a comparison of the mean vote share of the main party families by decade.

All the main large party families have lost vote share over the last decades. Social Democrats have lost to Greens and Socialists/Communists.

Nevertheless, I was surprised how relatively stable the mean vote by party family has been.

```{r family, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pa_fam <- elec %>%
  filter( ! family %in% c('code', 'none', 'spec')) %>%
  group_by(decade, election_id, family) %>%
  summarise(vote_share = sum(vote_share, na.rm=T)) %>%
  group_by(decade, family)

# use reshape to add 0.0% for complete family data
pa_fam <-  pa_fam %>%
  spread(family, vote_share, fill = 0) %>%
  gather(family, vote_share, -election_id, -decade) %>%
  group_by(decade, family) %>%
  summarise(vote_share = mean(vote_share, na.rm=T))

fam_level <- c('com', 'eco', 'soc', 'agr', 'lib', 'chr', 'con', 'right')
fam_color <- c('#FB9A99', '#33A02C', '#E31A1C', '#B2DF8A', '#FDBF6F', '#FF7F00', '#1F78B4', '#A6CEE3')
pa_fam <- pa_fam %>% mutate(family = factor(family, fam_level))

pa_fam_pl <- pa_fam %>% 
  left_join(turnout) %>% 
  mutate(vote_share_with_turnout = vote_share * turnout) %>% 
  select(-turnout) %>% 
  gather(turnout, vote_share, -decade, -family)

ggplot(pa_fam_pl, aes(decade, vote_share, fill=family)) +
  geom_area(position = 'stack') +
  scale_fill_manual(values = fam_color) +
  facet_grid(. ~ turnout)

pa_fam_wide <- pa_fam %>%
  mutate(vote_share = round(vote_share, 0)) %>%
  spread(decade, vote_share, fill = 0)
pa_fam_wide %>% kable
```


# Electoral losses

## Cost or ruling

Parties in cabinet tend to loose votes. A fact that political scientists refer to as the cost of ruling (see [Nannestad/Paldam 2002](https://books.google.de/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vdGeUywOkR0C&oi=fnd&pg=PA17&dq=Nannestad+Paldam&ots=h_OVPMvfjk&sig=xCIfGOoG2maiD8UkKeIeu11QOPU&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Nannestad%20Paldam&f=false)).


```{r cost_ruling, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
elec_prev <- elec %>%
  filter( ! paste(election_id, party_id) %in% alliance) %>%
  left_join(cab_party) %>%
  mutate(cabinet = ifelse(is.na(cabinet), 'no', 'yes') %>% factor(c('yes', 'no'))) %>%
  select(country, party_id, cabinet,
         previous_parliament_election_id = election_id,
         vote_share_last = vote_share)

party_url <- '[%s](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/%s/party/%s/)'

loss <- elec %>%
  inner_join(elec_prev) %>%
  mutate(change = vote_share - vote_share_last,
         year = year(election_date),
         name = party_name_english,
         party = sprintf(party_url, party_name_short, country_name_short, party_id)) %>%
  select(country, year, cabinet, party, name, family, last=vote_share_last, share=vote_share, change) %>%
  mutate_each(funs(round(.,1)), last, share, change) %>%
  arrange(change)

ggplot(loss, aes(share, change, color=cabinet)) + geom_smooth() + xlim(c(0, 50))
```

## Largest vote losses

Here, I list the largest vote losses (excluding alliances). All of the parties were members of cabinet in the previous legislative term.

The __PVdA__ was the smaller coaliton party in the [Rutte III](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/NLD/cabinet/2012-11-05/)
cabinet but a vote share __loss of 19.1%__ (from 24.8% in 2012 to 5.7% in 2017) is exceptional.

Given the modest size of the PVdA in recent elections with about 20% vote share, only [Kadima](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/ISR/party/1870/) in Israel suffered a similar electoral defeat. However, Kadima was competing with a splinter party 
([Hatnuah](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/isr/party/2320/)) and the combined vote share reduces the electoral loss in comparative perspective.

```{r share_loss, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
loss %>% top_n(-20) %>% kable
```


# Largest party vote share

## Smallest largest party

Recently, elections in several countries have resulted in largest parties with only about 20% vote share.

```{r share_max, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
elec_url <- '[%s](http://www.parlgov.org/explore/%s/election/%s/)'

elec_max <- elec %>%
  mutate(year = year(election_date)) %>%
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  mutate(share_max = round(max(vote_share, na.rm=T), 1)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  mutate(year = sprintf(elec_url, year, country_name_short, election_date)) %>%
  arrange(share_max) %>%
  distinct(country, .keep_all=T) %>%
  select(country, year, party=party_name_short, share_max)

elec_max %>% top_n(10, -share_max) %>% kable
```

## Largest party share by decade

This is the result of a general decline in the vote share of the largest party and more fragmented party systems.

```{r share_decade, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
decade <- elec %>%
  group_by(country, decade) %>%
  summarise(share_max = round(max(vote_share, na.rm=T), 0))

ggplot(decade, aes(factor(decade), share_max)) + geom_boxplot()

decade_wide <- decade %>% tidyr::spread(decade, share_max)
knitr::kable(decade_wide)
```

# Updates

Initial analysis on 16 March 2017.

Minor updates afterwards:

 * added cabinet status to vote share loss
 * added turnout to party family vote share plot
 * switched colors of liberals and right party families
