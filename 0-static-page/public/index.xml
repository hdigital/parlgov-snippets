      <title>Validation of cabinets in Western Europe</title>

      <guid>/2022/01/28/validation-of-cabinets-in-western-europe/</guid>
      <description>We validated the Western European cabinets with the recently published “Coalition Governance in Western Europe” (Bergman ea. 2021). No major changes or updates were added. All minor corrections are documented in the change log.
In ParlGov, we record investiture votes mainly for recent cabinets (see codebook). Nevertheless, we have added some historical investiture votes for cabinets in Western Europe if we found a primary news source such as Reuters, AFP or AP.</description>

      <description>Status
The new static page at parlgov.org is a gateway to recent additions to the ParlGov data (development version).
The ParlGov project is active and alive. Currently, we are adding the data for the first half of 2021.
Here, we will provide project news and updates of the data.
In September 2021, our long term hosting of the dynamic web page ended. Unfortunately, we were not able to migrate the page — see details below.</description>

      <description>We are currently updating the ParlGov data for 2020 and are moving to a new interval of updating our data.
In 2020, we stopped providing regular updates within about three months. Some internal changes and an effort to collect the data with less resources are behind these changes.
We have not finally determined the new agenda for updating ParlGov data but will do so after we have completed the 2020 update.</description>

      <guid>/2020/06/01/twitter-news-tracker-depreciated/</guid>
      <description>Our Twitter news tracker was mainly based on an automatic classification of Reuters news entries. We curated the automatically posted tweets regularly by removing false positives and added a few references from time to time manually.
The automatic classification and curation was based on some older Python scripts (tweetpy, nltk, scikit-learn, flask) that stopped working today. The code would need a substantial rewrite and curating the automatic posts did also take some time regularly.</description>

      <description>ParlGov provides links of party IDs to some of the main data sets with information about political parties. However, these party links in ParlGov have not been updated for some time and we have concentrated our efforts to link parties across data sets in the Party Facts project. An article introducing the project was recently published in Party Politics (Döring and Regel 2019) and archived versions of the data are available at the Party Facts Dataverse.</description>

      <description>For users of ParlGov, it is often not straightforward to understand how to create new datasets based on the core information in ParlGov. Users are interested in creating datasets on electoral gains and losses, government composition by party family or the party composition of EU institutions. Over the years, we have regularly written and revised scripts for our work and for colleagues to create these datasets based on information in ParlGov.</description>

Please make use of the development version if you need recent elections. We aim to include new information within three months. Updates are announced in the news section and bug fixes in the changelog.</description>

      <description>Two facts were striking in yesterdays election in the Netherlands.
 The Social Democracts (PVdA) fell from 24.8% in 2012 to 5.7% vote share. The largest party (Liberals, VVD) won only 21.3% vote share.  A ParlGov analysis in R presents a broader picture. It does also demonstrate how the R tidyverse and knitr make analysing ParlGov data more easy.</description>

      <description>We are in the process of cleaning up the data in ParlGov. Our goal is to provide reliable data for parties, elections and cabinets in &amp;ldquo;all EU and OECD democracies&amp;rdquo;. We are almost there with only some OECD countries and a few election results (EU members) of parties that won no seats missing. However, the documentation still leaves room for improvement and there need to be some more routines that check for data consistency.</description>

      <description>We have completed recoding our party families. All parties are now classified into one of the main categories first and additional party families are recorded in the table &amp;lsquo;party_family&amp;rsquo; only. Our main categories are primarily based on a two dimensional perspective (state/market and liberty/authority) of the political space and follow other typologies of party families. These party families are now also used to impute missing party positions by the mean value for the respective party family.</description>

We presented a research paper on the effects of electoral systems on cabinet formation and gave a presentation on ParlGov, pointing out successes and failures of the project. In Lund, we had many interesting discussions about the current state of research on democratic governments. Thanks to the organisers for welcoming us to Lund.</description>

      <description>In Germany, CDU and CSU run independently in elections without competing at the state level. Both parties form a joint parliamentary group in the German parliament after the election. This fact has now also been included into ParlGov. CDU and CSU are kept distinct in our election results but the joint party group is recorded in our parliament change data. As a consequence most of the cabinets including the CDU/CSU are no surplus coalitions anymore.</description>

      <description>ParlGov party positions are based on various party expert surveys (Castles/Mair 1983, Huber/Inglehart 1995, Ray 1999, Benoit/Laver 2006 and CHESS 2010). These positions are just the mean value of all observations available from these sources in a particular dimension (left_right, state_market, liberty_authority, eu_anti_pro).
There was a bug in the scripts that converted the data from Benoit/Laver and not all positions from the data set were included into the calculation. We became aware of the issue, when someone pointed out the extremely moderate left/right position of the German far-right NPD in ParlGov.</description>

      <description>We have added the results of the October 2011 election in Switzerland and the new Bundesrat. Swiss citizens have multiple votes in some cantons and official statistics calculate comparable number of votes (“fiktive Wählende”) for all parties at the federal level. Official election results were provided by the Statistical Office of Switzerland (BFS) and we would like to thank Madeleine Schneider (BFS) and Georg Lutz (University of Lausanne) for providing important details.</description>

The cabinet Radičová I lost a confidence vote and became a caretaker government without a formal resignation. Following our coding rules we coded it as an equivalent to a substantively meaningful resignation due to a change into a caretaker cabinet.</description>

      <description>We have added the new cabinet under President Christofias. The reshuffle became necessary after ministers of the junior coalition partner DIKO quit. When updating the previous cabinet, we realized that the termination date of cabinet Christofias I has to be recoded. We split the former cabinet into Christofias I and Christofias II.</description>

      <description>We have finally updated and checked all election results for Poland and coded all parties with more than 0.5% of the vote share in national and EP elections. This has led to a significant extension and partial revision of the party codings due to the volatility of the Polish party system over the last two decades. We have tried to include all relevant information about electoral alliances and links between parties.</description>

      <description>There has been another change in the party composition of the Slovenian government when Zares ministers resigned on 27 June. We have added this change by recoding the start date of the Pahor II cabinet.
This particular recoding highlights one of the cabinet coding rules we have developed. Cabinet terminations as defined by political scientists (election, change party or pm, cabinet resignation) are sometimes followed by additional events that would define a new cabinet.</description>

      <description>We have started to be on Twitter &amp;ndash; twitter.com/ParlGov. These tweets will be a more informal supplement to the news section and hopefully help us to better track the political events we include into ParlGov. It shall give all users a better understanding about the events we follow and about changes to the webpage we apply. Hopefully it will also encourage others to make us aware of events that should be included.</description>

      <description>We have also added the recently formed French cabinet that had previously resigned. The cabinet stepped down to allow President Sarkozy to appoint a new reshuffled cabinet.
Adding this cabinet was a little delayed by the recent stable release. Most of the new observations are added within a week after an event took place or the official information (election statistics) are available.</description>

      <description>We are cooperating with the European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO). One of the core projects of EUDO is setting up the EUDO Data Centre which will also host the ParlGov data. There are many advantages of making use of the Dataverse software to distribute data sets.
Over the past months, we have supported the EUDO Data Centre team and last week&amp;rsquo;s EUDO Dissemination Conference in Brussels was the place to present the current state of the data centre.</description>

There is an earlier news entry that gives a summary of the changes that come with this new version and the changelog provides a very detailed list of all changes. Most significant for users of previous versions is the change of all id variables as well as most table and variable names. Again, these changes turn ParlGov into a significantly cleaner data structure.</description>

      <description>We have added the party codes of the European Parliament Election Study 2009, Voter Study, Advance Release, 30/06/2010. to our main party table. Here is an example of the Swedish parties. The original data set is available at the website of the PIREDEU project.
Integrating EES party ids allows us to combine this information with all other data sets that are linked through our party table. One of the goals was it to establish an interface between EES and EUProfiler party ids.</description>

      <description>We have just put online the implementation of our new web design and the refactored database schema.
Implementing the new design, developed by Jens Hoffmeister from underline webdesign, has kept us busy for the last three months. In addition to applying the new layout, we have used the opportunity to significantly clean up the structure of our html templates. The web design has already been very well received by some of our colleagues who gave their views on the new layout.</description>

      <description>We have moved to another university and are now based at the Centre for Social Policy Research (ZeS), University of Bremen.
For ParlGov, our time at the European University Institute (EUI) and the University of Heidelberg has been very productive. It was the academic year when we released the first public version of the projects and both institutions have provided significant support in finding out how ParlGov is received.
We keep a connection to the EUI through our cooperation with the EUDO Data Centre project.</description>

      <description>Today (12 October), we finished adding all votes level data for Belgium. For the country, there is a good official source with the results of all national and European Parliament elections and most of our updated information is from this source. Nevertheless, coding the Belgium parties is always a challenge especially for the 1970s. We did our best to link all existing parties. Nevertheless some enhancements may be suggested by country experts later on.</description>

      <description>It takes some time until the final result of an election is determined in Australia, due to the complexity of the electoral system. The election took place in August and a dramatic process of government formation followed. Nevertheless, the official election results have only been presented recently.
We have added the Australian election and the new minority cabinet to ParlGov.</description>

      <description>Yesterday (5 October) was an interesting day for students of cabinet formation. The Swedish prime minister presented his new minority cabinet after failing to enlarge his coalition. In the Netherlands, the Christian Democrats party group approved the formation of a new and highly controversial minority government supported by Geert Wilders Freedom Party. In Belgium, coalition talks on government formation have collapsed on the same day.
We have included the results of the recent elections in Sweden and the new cabinet.</description>

      <guid>/2010/09/28/parlgov-ii--database-refactoring/</guid>
      <description>The second major change for the next ParlGov version will be a major refactoring of our database design. The causes for the need to refactor the structure of our database are similar to the previously described plans to relaunch the web design. Some of the fundamental design decisions were made at the early stages of the project and limit its growth now. Over time, our experience and technical expertise has grown and we are convinced that the benefits of a redesign outweigh the (transformation) costs.</description>

The old design with the current layout, logo and colors has not changed over the last five years and there were only some improvements to the navigation. Honestly, it was in strong need of a fresh look.</description>

      <description>We have added all Swiss cabinets into ParlGov. Determining a cabinet for Switzerland according to the four criteria defining a cabinet was a little difficult. We decided not to code a prime minister in the case of Switzerland so that we have one cabinet for every legislative term that ends with an election.</description>

      <description>A first release of ParlGov was scheduled for January. Let us specify how we proceed with the release. Tomorrow, we will provide a first beta version at www.parlgov.org and will ask for some feedback. To this version, we also have to add some very minor corrections. A week later, we will introduce a second version for testing purposes, including recommendations and fixed open issues. The first official version of our data project will be ParlGov 10/02 (February 2010) and we release it in the third week of February.</description>

      <description>This took a while, but we have now finished adding results of the European Parliament Election 2009 from last June. For most countries we were able to make use of official election results. Adding almost thirty elections, with a lot of electoral alliances took some time. As always, we tried to code all parties with more than 0.5% of the national vote. National elections and government formations that took place before the EP election in June are already included.</description>

      <description>ParlGov was started at the MPIfG in Colgone in Germany in 2005 and is the home country of the project leaders. Hence, this is the country were we have most expertise and that we keep updated as a reference country for the coding. Therefore, we have added the new cabinet just at the day when Angela Merkel was re-elected as chancellor in the German Bundestag. To better understand the fine grained coding that we have already included into ParlGov for Germany, have a look at the election results for 1969 and see the coding of changes in the party composition of the Bundestag.</description>

      <description>We have finished double checking our data on parties, election outcomes and government compositions for the Central- and East European EU member states. Government composition data was compared to information provided by Müller-Rommel ea. (2008) and EJPR Yearbooks.
Our electoral results on Central- and Eastern Europe still lack a systematic coding of electoral alliances and an inclusion of official election results. Please let us know if you notice any data bugs.</description>
