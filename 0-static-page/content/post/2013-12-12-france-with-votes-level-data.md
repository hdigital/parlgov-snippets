title: France with votes level data
---

We have updated all election results for [France](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/fra/) from seats to votes level data. Due to the poorly documented information the coding has taken up some time. For the same reason it is based on three sources: [Mackie and Rose (1991)](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/data_sources/#mackie), [Nohlen and Stöver (2010)](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/data_sources/#no2010) and [Assemblée nationale](http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/index.asp).
