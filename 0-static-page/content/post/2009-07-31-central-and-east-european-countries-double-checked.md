title: Central- and East European countries double checked
---

We have finished double checking our data on parties, election outcomes and government compositions for the Central- and East European EU member states. Government composition data was compared to information provided by MÃ¼ller-Rommel ea. (2008) and EJPR Yearbooks.

Our electoral results on Central- and Eastern Europe still lack a systematic coding of electoral alliances and an inclusion of official election results. Please let us know if you notice any data bugs.
