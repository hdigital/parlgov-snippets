We have added the [2018 stable version](http://www.parlgov.org/documentation/changelog/#2018) of the ParlGov data. An archived version is also available in the [ParlGov Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/F0YGNC).

The version name is now based on the year of the stable release. The 2018 version includes all elections and cabinets until March 2018.
