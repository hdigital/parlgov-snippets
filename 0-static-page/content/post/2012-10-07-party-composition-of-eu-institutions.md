title: Party composition of EU institutions
---

In the [download](http://dev.parlgov.org/download/) section we have added an application of 
ParlGov for students of the EU. The file contains scripts to create data about the party composition of the EU with information from the ParlGov project. All scripts are written in the R programing language. In addition, the European political space since 1958 is visualized including all changes in party composition. For the project, we also reintegrated [data](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/table/external_commissioner_doering/) on the compositon of the College of Commissioners and present it in the data section (eg. [Germany](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/deu/external_commission/)).
