title: Ireland with votes level data
---

We have updated all election results for [Ireland](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/irl/) since 1948 from seats to votes level data. Most of the coding is based on the work by [Gallagher (2009)](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/data_sources/#gall09) and the [Department of Environment Ireland](http://www.environ.ie/en/LocalGovernment/Voting/NationalElections/).
