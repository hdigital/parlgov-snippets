title: Luxembourg with votes level data
---

We have updated all election results for [Luxembourg]( http://testing.parlgov.org/data/lux/election-parliament/) from seats to votes level data.  For most of our information we used the official site of the [Ministry of internal affairs](http://www.elections.public.lu/fr/index.html) and the [Statistical Yearbooks of  Luxembourg](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/publications/series/annuaire-stat-lux/index.html). The voting system is based on multiple votes and therefore the number of votes exceeds the number of eligible voters.
