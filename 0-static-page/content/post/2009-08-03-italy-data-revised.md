title: Italy data revised
---

Election results and government composition data on Italy has been thoroughly revised. ParlGov now includes the official election results. Working on Italy has also brought a new table parl_alliance into ParlGov to code the membership in electoral alliances. See the 1994 and succeeding parliamentary election for a wide use of this coding scheme.
