title: ParlGov snippets on Github
---

For users of ParlGov, it is often not straightforward to understand how to create new datasets based on the core information in ParlGov. Users are interested in creating datasets on electoral gains and losses, government composition by party family or the party composition of EU institutions. Over the years, we have regularly written and revised scripts for our work and for colleagues to create these datasets based on information in ParlGov.

We have started to review and update some of these scripts that we have worked with regularly and will make them available in a new __[ParlGov Snippets Github](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets)__ repository. We'll post brief news entries here and introduce the respective scripts we add to the repository.
