title: Australia with votes level data
---

We have updated [election results]( 
http://dev.parlgov.org/data/aus/election-parliament/) for Australia from 
seats to votes level data and added elections and [cabinets](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/aus/cabinet-party/) from 1901 to 1943. For most of our information we used publications of the 
[Statistics and Mapping Section of the Australian Parliament]( 
http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/).
