title: Hungary with votes level data
---

We have updated all election results for [Hungary](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/fra/) from seats to votes level data. The coding is mainly based on the [National Election Committee Hungary](http://www.valasztas.hu/) and the [Essex CEE elections database](http://www2.essex.ac.uk/elect/database/election.asp).
