title: EP election results (preliminary)
---

We have added the results of last monthâ€™s European Parliament election. This data collection was supported by a student seminar at the University of Bremen led by Philip Manow. Many thanks to all the contributors. All entries have been initially validated.
The results are preliminary but can be used for analyses. This summer, we will add the number of votes, further specify some information for new parties and conduct another validation with the primary sources.
