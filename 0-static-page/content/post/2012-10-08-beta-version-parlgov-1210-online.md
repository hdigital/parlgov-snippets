title: Beta version ParlGov 12/10 online
---

We are preparing a new stable version, ParlGov 12/10 -- Autumn 2012 and a [beta version](http://www.parlgov.org/stable/index.html) is now available online. We provide at least one stable version a year, which is a frozen snap shot of our [development version](http://dev.parlgov.org/). All significant changes since the last stable version are documented in the [changelog](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/ChangeLog). We plan to release the stable version at the beginning of next week.
