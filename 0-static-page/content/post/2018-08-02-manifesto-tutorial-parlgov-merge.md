title: Manifesto tutorial ParlGov merge
---

There is a nice tutorial about [Adding partiesâ€™ government/opposition status to the manifesto project dataset using ParlGov data](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/tutorials/parlgov_merge) by Nicolas Merz and Fabio Ellger from the Manifesto group.

It reminds us to update the Manifesto codes in ParlGov and encourages us to publish some more tutorials on [ParlGov snippets](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets).
