title: ParlGov in Lund
---

Last week, we were invited to Lund by Hanna Bäck, Torbjörn Bergman and Johan Hellström for a workshop on coalition governments in established democracies. We presented a research paper on the effects of electoral systems on cabinet formation and gave a presentation on ParlGov, pointing out successes and failures of the project. In Lund, we had many interesting discussions about the current state of research on democratic governments. Thanks to the organisers for welcoming us to Lund.
