title: Party Facts party linking
---

ParlGov provides links of party IDs to some of the main data sets with information about political parties. However, these party links in ParlGov have not been updated for some time and we have concentrated our efforts to link parties across data sets in the [Party Facts](https://partyfacts.herokuapp.com/) project. An article introducing the project was recently published in Party Politics ([Döring and Regel 2019](https://doi.org/10.1177/1354068818820671)) and archived versions of the data are available at the [Party Facts Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/partyfacts).
