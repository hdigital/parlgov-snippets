title: ParlGov 11/07 released
---

We have now released ParlGov 11/07 (26 July 2011), the third major stable release of the ParlGov project. There have been no changes to the release candidate we put online a couple of days ago. ParlGov 11/07 includes all elections and cabinets until the mid of July for the countries we cover. In this version we have added elections and cabinets in Japan from 1945 to 1958 and updated Austria, Cyprus, Poland from seats to votes level data. Finally, there has been a number of smaller updates and corrections that are listed in the [changelog](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/ChangeLog#Version1107).
