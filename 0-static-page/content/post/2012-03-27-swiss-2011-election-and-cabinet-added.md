title: Swiss 2011 election and cabinet added
---

We have added the results of the October 2011 [election](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/che/election-parliament/2011-10-23/) in Switzerland and the new [Bundesrat](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/che/cabinet-party/2011-12-14/). Swiss citizens have multiple votes in some cantons and official statistics calculate comparable number of votes (“fiktive Wählende”) for all parties at the federal level. [Official election](http://www.portal-stat.admin.ch/nrw/files/de/01.xml) results were provided by the Statistical Office of Switzerland (BFS) and we would like to thank Madeleine Schneider (BFS) and Georg Lutz (University of Lausanne) for providing important details.
