title: Cyprus with new cabinet
---

We have added the new [cabinet](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/cyp/cabinet-party/2011-08-05/) under President Christofias. The reshuffle became necessary after ministers of the junior coalition partner DIKO quit.
When updating the previous cabinet, we realized that the termination date of cabinet [Christofias I](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/cyp/cabinet-party/2008-02-28/) has to be recoded. We split the former cabinet into Christofias I and [Christofias II](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/cyp/cabinet-party/2010-03-02/).
