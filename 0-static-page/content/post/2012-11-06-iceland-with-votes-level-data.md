title: Iceland with votes level data
---

We have updated all [election results]( http://dev.parlgov.org/data/isl/election-parliament/) in Iceland from seats to votes level data. We coded [all parties]( http://dev.parlgov.org/data/isl/party/) with more than 1% of the vote share, that won seats in parliament or the largest party winning no seats in an election. In addition, we unified the election date coded to the last date of an election and indicate all early elections.
