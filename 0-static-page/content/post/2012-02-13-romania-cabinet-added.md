title: Romania cabinet added
---

We have added the fall of the [Boc III]( http://dev.parlgov.org/data/rou/cabinet-party/2010-05-19/) government in February 2012 and added the succeeding cabinet under [PM Ungureanu]( http://dev.parlgov.org/data/rou/cabinet-party/2012-02-09/). In this context we recoded the [Boc II]( http://dev.parlgov.org/data/rou/cabinet-party/2009-12-23/) government and split it into Boc II and Boc III due to a change in the cabinet composition in 2010.
