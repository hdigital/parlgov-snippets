title: Canada with votes level data
---

We have updated all election results for [Canada](/data/can/election-parliament/) since 1945 from seats to votes level data. Our coding relies on data provided by [Chief Electoral Officer of Canada](http://www.elections.ca/home.aspx), [Constituency-Level Elections Archive](http://www.electiondataarchive.org/) as well as [Parliament of Canada](http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/).
