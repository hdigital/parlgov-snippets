title: Party clean up
---

Following the [recent update](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/news/#99) of coding rules for our election results, we have also cleaned up the parties included into ParlGov. Fur this purpose, we removed minor parties without election results according to our new criteria (1.0% vote share or 2 seats). A more detailed summary of coding rules for parties, election results and cabinets will follow over the next month.
