title: Biyearly stable releases
---

We decided to move to a biyearly relase of the stable version. ParlGov is a stable project by now. We mainly include updates for recent elections and new cabinets as well as minor bug fixes. Currently, we are not planning any major additions to the projects.

Please make use of the [development version](http://www.parlgov.org/#data) if you need recent elections. We aim to include new information within three months. Updates are announced in the [news section](http://www.parlgov.org/documentation/news/) and bug fixes in the [changelog](http://www.parlgov.org/documentation/changelog/).
