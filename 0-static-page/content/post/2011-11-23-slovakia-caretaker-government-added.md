title: Slovakia caretaker government added
---

We have added the fall of the [Radičová I](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/svk/cabinet-party/2010-07-08/) government and added the succeeding caretaker government [Radičová II](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/svk/cabinet-party/2011-10-20/). The cabinet Radičová I lost a confidence vote and became a caretaker government without a formal resignation. Following our [coding rules](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/DocCabinet?version=52) we coded it as an equivalent to a substantively meaningful resignation due to a change into a caretaker cabinet.
