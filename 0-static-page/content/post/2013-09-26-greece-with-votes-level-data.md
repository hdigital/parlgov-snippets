title: Greece with votes level data
---

We have updated all election results for [Greece](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/grc/election-parliament/) from seats to votes level data. The coding is based on [Nohlen and St√∂ver (2010)](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/data_sources/#no2010) and [Helenic Republic - Ministry of Interior](http://www.ypes.gr/en).
