title: France Fillon III cabinet added
---

We have also added the recently formed [French cabinet](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/fra/cabinet-party/2010-11-14/) that had previously resigned. The cabinet stepped down to allow President Sarkozy to appoint a new reshuffled cabinet.

Adding this cabinet was a little delayed by the recent stable release. Most of the new observations are added within a week after an event took place or the official information (election statistics) are available.
