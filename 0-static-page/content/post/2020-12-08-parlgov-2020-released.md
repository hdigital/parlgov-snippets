title: ParlGov 2020 released
---

We have added the [2020 stable version](http://www.parlgov.org/documentation/changelog/#2020) of the ParlGov data. An archived version is also available in the [ParlGov Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/Q6CVHX, ). The 2020 version includes all elections and cabinets until March 2020.

This has been an a challenging year. We will post updates about our future plans with ParlGov at some later stage.
