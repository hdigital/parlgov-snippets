We are cooperating with the  [European Union Democracy Observatory (EUDO)](http://www.eui.eu/Projects/EUDO/Home.aspx). One of the core projects of EUDO is setting up the [EUDO Data Centre](http://www.eui.eu/Projects/EUDO/EUDODataCentre.aspx) which will also host the ParlGov data. There are many advantages of making use of the Dataverse software to distribute data sets.

Over the past months, we have supported the EUDO Data Centre team and last week's EUDO Dissemination Conference in Brussels was the place to present the current state of the data centre. Lorenzo de Sio (EUI) gave a longer presentation about the EUDO Data Centre and we summarized our experience from working with the EUDO team.

We will post a separate news entry about the promises of distributing ParlGov data through the EUDO Data Centre later on.
