title: ParlGov on Twitter
---

We have started to be on Twitter -- [twitter.com/ParlGov](http://twitter.com/#!/ParlGov). These tweets will be a more informal supplement to the [news section](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/news/) and hopefully help us to better track the political events we include into ParlGov. It shall give all users a better understanding about the events we follow and about changes to the webpage we apply. Hopefully it will also encourage others to make us aware of events that should be included.
