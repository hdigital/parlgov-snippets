title: EU Profiler parties added
---

Here at the European University Institute, [Alexander Trechsel](http://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/PoliticalAndSocialSciences/People/Professors/Profiles/AlexanderTrechsel.aspx) has kindly provided a list of the parties from the [EU Profiler](http://euprofiler.eu/) project with party names and their IDs. We have now linked all these parties to the ParlGov parties and added the new ones. The full EU Profiler data set will be published in 2010.
