title: Mannheim presentation
---

Another Tuesday presentation: Yesterday, we gave a presentation about ParlGov and our ideas on the future of collaborative data collection at the conference "Quantifying Europe" in Mannheim (Collaborative Research Center SFB 884 'Political Economy of Reforms' and Mannheim Center for European Social Research [MZES]). It was the first talk that focussed almost exclusively on ParlGov and we discussed potential applications of ParlGov to map political actors in the European Union. We have to thank the organisers and conference participants for very insightful discussions.
