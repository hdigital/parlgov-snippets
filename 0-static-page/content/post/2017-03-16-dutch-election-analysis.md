title: Dutch election analysis

Two facts were striking in yesterdays election in the Netherlands.

* The Social Democracts (PVdA) fell from 24.8% in 2012 to 5.7% vote share.
* The largest party (Liberals, VVD) won only 21.3% vote share.

A [ParlGov analysis in R](http://holgerdoering.net/documents/nld-election-2017.html) presents a broader picture. It does also demonstrate how the R [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) and [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) make analysing ParlGov data more easy.
