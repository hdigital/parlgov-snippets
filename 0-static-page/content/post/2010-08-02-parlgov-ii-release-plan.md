title: ParlGov II -- release plan
---

We have started to push our work on the next stable version of ParlGov and aim to have a beta version by the end of the month. This new version includes two major changes: a **new webdesign** and a **database refactoring**. In addition, it includes recent political events and some data revisions. The [changelog](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/ChangeLog) in the ParlGov Development wiki lists all data updates. We also aim at fixing all [tickets](http://wiki.parlgov.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&order=priority&priority=high&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=priority&col=status&col=owner&col=reporter&milestone=1.1) that are assigned to 'milestone 1.1' and have priority 'high'.

The final release of the second stable version of ParlGov is scheduled for the end of September. We will post a second news entry to describe the new webdesign and the causes for the database refactoring.
