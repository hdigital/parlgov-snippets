title: Defector parties column for cabinets 
---

The table cab_party now includes an additional column to code defector parties. With this observation we indicate if a party left a governing coaliton. Including this variable was inspired by Tavits' 2008 paper *The Role of Partiesâ€™ Past Behavior in Coalition Formation*.
