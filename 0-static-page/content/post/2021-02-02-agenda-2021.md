title: Agenda 2021

We are currently updating the ParlGov data for 2020 and are moving to a new interval of updating our data.

In 2020, we stopped providing regular updates within about three months. Some internal changes and an effort to collect the data with less resources are behind these changes.

We have not finally determined the new agenda for updating ParlGov data but will do so after we have completed the 2020 update.

Further information will be posted in the news entries.
