title: EP turnout data completed
---

We completed the coding of turnout data for all elections to the European Parliament. In ParlGov, some countries are coded at the vote level others at the seat level only. For the former, we have recorded the official election results for all parties with more than 0.5% of the vote share and turnout data is included in the coding of these countries. For seat level data, we collect only the number of seats and the percentage of votes but plan to add vote level data at some later stage. The wiki page on [country coding](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/CountryInfo) gives information about the level of coding. Nevertheless, we have now included information on turnout for all EP elections.
