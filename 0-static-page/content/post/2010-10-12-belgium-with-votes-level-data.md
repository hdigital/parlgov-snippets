title: Belgium with votes level data
---

Today (12 October), we finished adding all votes level data for Belgium. For the country, there is a good [official source](http://www.ibzdgip.fgov.be/result/selectlanguage.php) with the results of all national and European Parliament elections and most of our updated information is from this source. Nevertheless, coding the Belgium parties is always a challenge especially for the 1970s. We did our best to link all existing parties. Nevertheless some enhancements may be suggested by country experts later on.

With "votes level data" we cover all parties that gained more than 0.5 percentage of the votes in post-war national and EP elections. It is our long term goal to move from "seats level data" to "votes level data" for all OECD/EU countries in the post-war period.  Only the latter level allows to use ParlGov as a device for research and teaching about electoral systems.
