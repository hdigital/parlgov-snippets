title: EES party ids added
---

We have added the [party codes](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/table/external_party_ees/) of the *European Parliament Election Study 2009, Voter Study, Advance Release, 30/06/2010.* to our main [party table](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/table/view_party/). Here is an example of the [Swedish parties](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/swe/external_ees/). The original data set is available at the website of the [PIREDEU project](http://www.piredeu.eu/).

Integrating EES party ids allows us to combine this information with all other data sets that are linked through our party table. One of the goals was it to establish an interface between [EES](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/table/external_party_ees/) and [EUProfiler](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/table/external_party_euprofiler/) party ids.

This information will also be part of the next stable release.
