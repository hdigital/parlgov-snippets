title: Snippet · PM small party
---

We added a [ParlGov snippet](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets/tree/master/z-legacy/pm-small-parties-2020) about the frequency of PMs from smaller parties.

The analysis was inspired by a [Fruits and Votes discussion](https://fruitsandvotes.wordpress.com/2020/02/05/thuringia-leader-of-smallest-party-in-state-parliament-elected-premier-with-afd-support/) about a controversial PM election in the German state of Thuringia — “How common it is for a party as small as the sixth largest in parliament to lead the government?”
