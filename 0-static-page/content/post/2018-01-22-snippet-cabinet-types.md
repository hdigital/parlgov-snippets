title: Snippet Â· cabinet types
---

We added a new [script](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets/tree/master/cabinet-type) to determine the cabinet type (minority, minimal winning, surplus) for all cabinets in ParlGov.

We also added a nice [map](https://github.com/hdigital/parlgov-snippets/tree/master/cabinet-party-family) to the party family snippet.
