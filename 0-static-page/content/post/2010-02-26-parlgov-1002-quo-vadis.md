title: ParlGov 10/02 â€” Quo vadis?
---

Just some notes about the status and quality of data in the ParlGov 10/02 release. We have been working with the data in ParlGov for many years. First, this was only an internal project. Over the last year, we have made significant efforts to clean up our data and to document tables, variables and data sources in order to provide a first version about our vision of the future of data collection in political science. This is what ParlGov 10/02 is about: a first version of a long term project and commitment on our side. We have a long list of future enhancement. However, from now onwards, we document all our changes and make sure that you can track the evolution of the project. At this point, most changes are a result of feedback we receive.
