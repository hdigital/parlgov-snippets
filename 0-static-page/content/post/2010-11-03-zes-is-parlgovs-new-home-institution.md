title: ZeS is ParlGov's new home institution
---

We have moved to another university and are now based at the [Centre for Social Policy Research (ZeS)](http://www.zes.uni-bremen.de/), University of Bremen.

For ParlGov, our time at the [European University Institute (EUI)](http://www.eui.eu/) and the [University of Heidelberg](http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/index_e.html) has been very productive. It was the academic year when we released the first public version of the projects and both institutions have provided significant support in finding out how ParlGov is received.

We keep a connection to the [EUI](http://www.eui.eu/) through our cooperation with the [EUDO Data Centre](http://dvn.eudo.eu/) project.
