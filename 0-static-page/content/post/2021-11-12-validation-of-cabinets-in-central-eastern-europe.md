title: Validation of cabinets in Central Eastern Europe
---

We validated the Central Eastern European cabinets with the recently published “Coalition Governance in Central Eastern Europe” (Bergman ea. 2019). No major changes or updates were added. All minor corrections are documented in the [change log](/documentation/changelog/). 

In ParlGov, we record investiture votes mainly  for recent cabinets ([see codebook](/documentation/codebook/#cabinet)). Nevertheless, we have added some historical investiture votes for cabinets in Central Eastern Europe if we found a primary news source such as Reuters, AFP or AP.
