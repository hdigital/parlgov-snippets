We have added the [new Japanese cabinet](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/jpn/cabinet-party/2011-08-30/) under PM Noda. He follows [PM Kan](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/jpn/cabinet-party/2010-06-04/) who resigned after widespread criticism over his handling of  the tsunami and  Fukushima power plant crisis.
