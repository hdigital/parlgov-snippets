---

We have added the results of the recent [snap election](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/prt/election-parliament/2011-06-05/?sources=true) and the resulting new [Passos Coelho cabinet](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/prt/cabinet-party/2011-06-15/) in Portugal. The election followed the resignation of PM Socrates on 23 March after parliament rejected an austerity budget.
