---

Last week, we gave a presentation on "Programming in the social sciences" at the EUI workshop on [Research Skills for the World of Big Data](http://www.eui.eu/SeminarsAndEvents/Index.aspx?eventid=89071). We presented ParlGov as an application of computing in political science. Thanks to Jonathan Bright and Alexander Trechsel for inviting us.
