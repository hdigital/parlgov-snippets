title: IHS Vienna talk
---

On Tuesday, we gave a [public lecture](http://www.ihs.ac.at/vienna/resources/organizer/en_lecture_doering.pdf) about ParlGov and one of the projects that it originated from at the [Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS)](http://www.ihs.ac.at/vienna/) in Vienna. In the discussion following the presentation, we have received many valuable comments, feedback and encouragement. Many thanks to Johannes Pollak and Guido Tiemann for inviting and welcoming us at the IHS.
