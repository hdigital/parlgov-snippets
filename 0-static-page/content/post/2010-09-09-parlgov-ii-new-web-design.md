title: ParlGov II -- new web design
---

The next version of ParlGov will include a new web design and we have worked with Jens Hoffmeister from [underline webdesign](http://webdesign-underline.de/) over the last months to give our website a fresh look. Here is an [example](http://www.parlgov.org/misc/parlgov-new.html) of the new design.

The old design with the current layout, logo and colors has not changed over the last five years and there were only some improvements to the navigation. Honestly, it was in strong need of a fresh look. Jens has created the new design by defining a modern layout, color scheme and logo based on the existing pages. The structure of the pages will remain but some of the underlying html and css code has been significantly cleaned up.

Ones we have put up online a first beta version of the next release you will see how fresh and modern the new design is.
