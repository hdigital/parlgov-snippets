title: Slovenia change in cabinet composition
---

We have now added a new [Pahor cabinet](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/svn/cabinet-party/2011-05-19/) following a change in the party composition on 19 May when the last DeSUS minister withdrew from the party. The party previously decided to leave the cabinet.
