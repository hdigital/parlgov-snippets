---

We have now released [ParlGov 12/10]( http://www.parlgov.org/stable/), the fourth major stable version of the ParlGov project. There have been only minor changes and updates to the beta version we put online last week. ParlGov 12/10 includes all elections and cabinets until the end of August 2012 for the countries we cover. For the version we have added elections and cabinets in Switzerland from 1919 to 1947, in Australia from 1901 to 1945 and updated Australia and New Zealand from seats to votes level.
