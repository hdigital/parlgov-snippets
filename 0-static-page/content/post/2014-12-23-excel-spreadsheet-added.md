title: Excel spreadsheet added
---

We have added an [Excel spreadsheet](http://www.parlgov.org/static/data/parlgov.xlsx) of our main data. It includes sheets for the three main data tables (party, election, cabinet) and two documentation sheets (variable, readme). Importing the csv files has always caused some issues among our users due to different language and encoding settings.
