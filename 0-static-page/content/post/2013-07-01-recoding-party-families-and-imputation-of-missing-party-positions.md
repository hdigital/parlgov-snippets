title: Recoding party families and imputation of missing party positions
---

We have completed recoding our party families. All parties are now classified into one of the main categories first and additional party families are recorded in the table 'party_family' only. Our main categories are primarily based on a two dimensional perspective (state/market and liberty/authority) of the political space and follow other typologies of party families. These party families are now also used to impute missing party positions by the mean value for the respective party family.
