Today, we contributed to a class session of [Conor Little's](http://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/academic_staff/?pure=en/persons/500201) seminar on "Parties in government. Who gets in? Who gets what? How long will it last?" at the University of Copenhagen. In class, we gave a hands-on introduction to ParlGov.
