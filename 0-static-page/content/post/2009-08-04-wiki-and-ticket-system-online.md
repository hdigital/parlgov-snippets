---

A project management system for ParlGov with a wiki and an issue management system is now online ([wiki.parlgov.org](http://wiki.parlgov.org/)). We make use of the [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) system. This software uses a different authentication system and you have to login separately. Use *guest* and *ParlGovGuest* to login.
