title: ParlGov 10/11 online -- second stable release
---

Today, we have put online the second stable release of our project, [ParlGov 10/11](http://www.parlgov.org/stable). There is an [earlier news entry](http://dev.parlgov.org/documentation/news/#56) that gives a summary of the changes that come with this new version and the [changelog](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/ChangeLog#Version1011) provides a very detailed list of all changes. Most significant for users of previous versions is the change of all id variables as well as most table and variable names. Again, these changes turn ParlGov into a significantly cleaner data structure.

More information about the plans and schedule for the next version will follow in a separate news post.
