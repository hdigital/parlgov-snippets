title: Poland with votes level data
---

We have finally updated and checked all [election results](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/pol/election-parliament/) for Poland and coded all [parties](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/pol/party/) with more than 0.5% of the vote share in national and EP elections. This has led to a significant extension and partial revision of the party codings due to the volatility of the Polish party system over the last two decades. We have tried to include all relevant information about electoral alliances and links between parties. Nevertheless, the coding of alliances and party changes may need an external validation by another country expert in the future.

Upgrading the Polish election results would not have been possible without the expertise and diligent work of Pawe≈Ç Szczerbak (University of Heidelberg).
