title: Sweden election results and government added
---

Yesterday (5 October) was an interesting day for students of cabinet formation. The Swedish prime minister presented his new minority cabinet after failing to enlarge his coalition. In the Netherlands, the Christian Democrats party group approved the formation of a new and highly controversial minority government supported by Geert Wilders Freedom Party. In Belgium, coalition talks on government formation have collapsed on the same day.

We have included the results of the recent elections in Sweden and the new cabinet. We will add the new Dutch government as soon as it is appointed.
