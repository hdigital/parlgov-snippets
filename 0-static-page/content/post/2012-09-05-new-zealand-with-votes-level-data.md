title: New Zealand with votes level data
---

We have updated and checked all [election results](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/nzl/election-parliament/) from 1943 for New Zealand and coded all parties according to our new coding rule. We include all parties with more than 1.0% vote share, that won seats in parliament or the largest party winning no seats in an election. For most of our informations we used the [Official Yearbooks](http://www.stats.govt.nz/) or the results of the [Electoral Commission](http://www.elections.org.nz/).
