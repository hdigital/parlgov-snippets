---

We have added all [elections](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/tur/election-parliament/) and [cabinets](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/tur/cabinet-party/) in [Turkey](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/tur/) since 1983 to ParlGov. The coding is based mainly on [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/) and [Turkish Statistical Institute](http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/Start.do).
