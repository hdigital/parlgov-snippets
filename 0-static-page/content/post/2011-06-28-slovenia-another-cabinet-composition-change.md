title: Slovenia - another cabinet composition change
---

There has been another change in the party composition of the Slovenian government when Zares ministers resigned on 27 June. We have added this change by recoding the start date of the [Pahor II](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/svn/cabinet-party/2011-06-27/) cabinet.

This particular recoding highlights one of the cabinet coding rules we have developed. Cabinet terminations as defined by political scientists (election, change party or pm, cabinet resignation) are sometimes followed by additional events that would define a new cabinet.  This may lead to defining some rather short lived (mostly technical) cabinets. We deal with the issue through a ‘three month rule’ and code continuation governments only if they last for more than three month. The [cabinet documentation](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/DocCabinet) gives some more detailed information and examples.
