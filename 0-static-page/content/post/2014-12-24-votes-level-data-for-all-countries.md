title: Votes level data for all countries
---

This December, we have completed updating all countries to 'votes level' data. The first versions of ParlGov included parties with seats in parliament and their vote share ('seats level'). Over the years we updated all [countries](http://www.parlgov.org/documentation/news/?type__short=votes) to 'votes level': adding the number of votes and parties with no seats in parliament and more than 1.0% vote share.
