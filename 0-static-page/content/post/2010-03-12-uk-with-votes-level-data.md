title: UK with votes level data 
---

We have coded the United Kingdom election results for all parties with more than 0.5% of the vote now and included the number of votes for these parties. These updates were included in the ParlGov 10/02 release already. Nevertheless, we have now also put up a [wiki page](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/CountryGbr) with open questions and comments about our codings.
