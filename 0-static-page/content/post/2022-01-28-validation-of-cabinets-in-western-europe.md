title: Validation of cabinets in Western Europe
---

We validated the Western European cabinets with the recently published “Coalition Governance in Western Europe” (Bergman ea. 2021). No major changes or updates were added. All minor corrections are documented in the [change log](/documentation/changelog/). 

In ParlGov, we record investiture votes mainly  for recent cabinets ([see codebook](/documentation/codebook/#cabinet)). Nevertheless, we have added some historical investiture votes for cabinets in Western Europe if we found a primary news source such as Reuters, AFP or AP.
