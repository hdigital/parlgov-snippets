title: ParlGov at Policy Votes conference
---

We were invited to the workshop "Political representation in Europe: Methods and data" organized by Christine Arnold (University of Maastrich) and Mark Franklin (European University Institute). The [Policy Votes](http://policyvotes.org/) project was presented and discussed at the workshop, an innovative and ambitious project to provide better data for studying representation in Western Europe at the voters, parties and legislative level. The project gathered researchers that presented work on modern data infrastructures for compartative politics: the [Manifesto Project (MRG/CMP/MARPOR)](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/), [PIREDEU](http://www.piredeu.eu/), the [Comparative Agendas Project (CAP)](http://www.comparativeagendas.org/), [RTextTools](http://www.rtexttools.com/) and the [Amsterdam Contentanalysis Toolkit (AmCAT)](http://amcat.vu.nl/p/amcat-introduction) as well as [ParlGov](www.parlgov.org).
