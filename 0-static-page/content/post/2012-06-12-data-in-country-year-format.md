title: Data in country-year format
---

We are preparing the next stable release. One of the features we have recently introduced is a base table to create data sets in country-year format where each observation covers information about a parliament or cabinet for every year. In the table [viewcalc_country_year_share](/documentation/table/viewcalc_country_year_share/) we provide weights for each parliament and cabinet for a given year. You can use this table with aggregated information at the parliament or cabinet level to create data sets in country-year format.
