title: Swiss cabinets added

We have added all Swiss cabinets into ParlGov. Determining a cabinet for Switzerland according to the [four criteria](http://wiki.parlgov.org/wiki/DocCabinet#Cabinetdefinition) defining a cabinet was a little difficult. We decided not to code a prime minister in the case of Switzerland so that we have one cabinet for every legislative term that ends with an election.
