title: Ray party expert survey IDs added
---

Updating ParlGov's party table to the most recent [CHESS data](http://www.unc.edu/~gwmarks/data_pp.php) required to include the party IDs from the [Ray expert survey](http://www.lsu.edu/faculty/lray2/data/1996survey/codebook.html) separately. We have now finished linking all party IDs from the Ray data set. Most of the IDs from CHESS and Ray's data are indentical but be aware that some of them are different.
