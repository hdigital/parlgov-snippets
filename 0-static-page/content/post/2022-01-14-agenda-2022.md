Our plans for 2022:

We are currently completing the coding of elections and cabinets for 2021.

We plan to publish the next stable release in March.

In 2022 we also want to move into a schedule where we publish a development version every six month at the currently used static page at [parlgov.org](https://parlgov.org/).
