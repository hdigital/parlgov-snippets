We are completing our work on a major new version of ParlGov. It will include all data updated to votes level, the 2014 EP election and a new version of the web page. This will complete our effort to establish ParlGov as a coherent source of information about parties, elections and cabinets. We will also start to streamline the project and remove some old cruft. Separate news entries will inform about the individual steps.
