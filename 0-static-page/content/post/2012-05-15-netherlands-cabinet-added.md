title: Netherlands cabinet added
---

Recently, we have added the fall of the [Rutte I cabinet](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/nld/cabinet-party/2010-10-14/) at the end of April in the Netherlands. In ParlGov, there is a [caretaker cabinet Rutte II](http://dev.parlgov.org/data/nld/cabinet-party/2012-04-23/) because the cabinet is asked to stay in office until elections take place in September.
