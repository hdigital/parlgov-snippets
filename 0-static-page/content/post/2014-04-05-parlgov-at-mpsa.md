title: ParlGov at MPSA
---

We had the chance to discuss current challenges of data integration in a very nice roundtable discussion at the MPSA conference in Chicago. The roundtable 'Coordinating Electoral and Institutional Data Assets for Data-Intensive Research: Developing a Vision for the Future' was organised by Thomas Mustillo (Purdue University) and included members of [CLEA](http://www.electiondataarchive.org/) (Ken Kollman, University of Michigan), the [EJPR Yearbook](http://www.politicaldatayearbook.com/) (Kevin Robert Deegan-Krause, Wayne State University), [PPDB Project](http://www.politicalpartydb.com/) (Susan E. Scarrow, University of Houston) and [DPEG](https://github.com/kbenoit/DPEG) (Alexander Herzog, LSE). In addition, we had a fantastic conversation with Ryan Bakker (University of Georgia), a principal investigator for the [CHES](http://www.chesdata.eu/). One result of these discussions was a renewed interest to link party IDs between the various projects.
