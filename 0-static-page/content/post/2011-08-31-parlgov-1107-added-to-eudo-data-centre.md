title: ParlGov 11/07 added to EUDO Data Centre
---

We have now added the most recent release of ParlGov to the [EUDO Data Centre](http://dvn.eudo.eu/dvn/dv/parlgov/faces/study/StudyPage.xhtml?studyId=19). In the data centre, you can download the main ParlGov tables (parties, elections, cabinets) and a documentation of these tables. The three main data sets are available in various formats (Stata, SPSS, R), are labelled and can be analysed online in the data centre.

A short technical note: The data sets offered in the data centre are derived from information that is available in the stable version. We automatically generate a couple of scripts to label the three main data tables with information from the documentation tables.
