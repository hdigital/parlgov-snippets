title: German cabinet added

ParlGov was started at the MPIfG in Colgone in Germany in 2005 and is the home country of the project leaders. Hence, this is the country were we have most expertise and that we keep updated as a reference country for the coding. Therefore, we have added the new cabinet just at the day when Angela Merkel was re-elected as chancellor in the German Bundestag. To better understand the fine grained coding that we have already included into ParlGov for Germany, have a look at the election results for 1969 and see the coding of changes in the party composition of the Bundestag.
