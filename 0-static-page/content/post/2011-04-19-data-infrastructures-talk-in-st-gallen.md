title: Data infrastructures talk in St. Gallen
---

We gave a presentation about our ideas of new data infrastructures in comparative politics at the [ECPR Joint Session](http://www.ecprnet.eu/joint_sessions/) in St. Gallen at the workshop on [Ministerial turnover and ministerial career paths in contemporary democracies](http://www.ecprnet.eu/joint_sessions/st_gallen/workshop_details.asp?workshopID=6). The workshop was organised by members of [SEDEPE](http://sedepe.net/), a network studying and collecting data on political careers. In the presentation we also summarised our experience from setting up the ParlGov project, its successes and its failures. Following several discussions over the conference some cooperation between SEDEPE and ParlGov is going to emerge over the coming months. Many thanks to Hanna BÃ¤ck (Mannheim), Luca Verzichelli (Siena) and Patrick Dumont (Luxembourg) for inviting us!
